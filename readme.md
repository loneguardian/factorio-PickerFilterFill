Standalone mod for ![Picker Inventory Tools'](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/PickerInventoryTools) Filter Fill

# Picker Filter Fill

Quickly and easily set filters and adjust requests using the handy dandy filter fill toolbar, Automatically shows up whenever you open a requester chest or filterable inventory. Requester chests can be made to quickly request all items in a blueprint by putting it in the first chest slot and clicking the button, or clicking the button with a blueprint in your hand. Copying from an assembler to a requester chest will add the new requests to the old ones instead of clearing them. Usefull for using one requester for multiple machines.
